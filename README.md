# About Stepper Motor - 
Stepper motor is a brushless DC motor that rotates in way. This is veritably useful because it can be precisely deposited without any feedback detector, which represents an open- circle regulator. The stepper motor consists of a rotor that's generally a endless attraction and it's girdled by the windings of the stator. As we spark the windings step by step in a particular order and let a current inflow through them they will captivate the stator and make electromagnetic poles independently that will beget propulsion to the motor. So that â€™ the introductory working principle of the stepper motors.
